Retail-Customer-Behavior-and-Shopping-Trends-analysis:

Overview:
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to analyze customer behavior, extract actionable insights, and present results through an interactive dashboard and report.

The project covers:
Data loading and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
SQL querying on relational databases
Data visualization and reporting

Dataset:
Type = Customer shopping / behavior dataset
Contents-
Customer demographics
Purchase history
Product categories
Subscription status
Shipping preferences
Review ratings
Source: CSV file (loaded into Python and SQL database)

Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – data loading, EDA, and cleaning
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – querying and aggregation
Power BI Desktop – interactive dashboard creation
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – Python execution

Project Steps:
Load the dataset using Python
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Clean and preprocess the data
Store data in a SQL database
Run SQL queries to answer business questions
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Dashboard:
The Power BI dashboard includes:
Total number of customers
Average purchase amount
Average review rating
Revenue by age group
Sales and revenue by product category
Subscription and shipping type analysis
Interactive filters (age group, gender, category, shipping type)

Key Insights / Results:
Identified high-value customer age groups
Analyzed revenue contribution by product category
Compared purchasing behavior of subscribed vs non-subscribed customers
Evaluated impact of shipping types on sales
Measured customer satisfaction using review ratings

How to Run the Project:
Python & EDA:
Open the Jupyter Notebook / Colab file
Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook cells in order

SQL:
Load cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Execute SQL queries provided in the SQL script

Power BI:
Open Power BI Desktop
Connect to the SQL database or import the cleaned dataset
Open the .pbix file to view the dashboard

Project Outcome:
This project demonstrates practical skills in:
Data analysis and problem-solving
SQL querying and database handling
Data visualization and storytelling
Building recruiter-ready dashboards and reports
